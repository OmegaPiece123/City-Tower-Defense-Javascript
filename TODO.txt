||  TO DO:  ||
  
1. Hover context menus for each tower in the shop -- displaying cost, sell price, and other stats
    - This would apply when you hover over any option in the shop and should appear next to the given option
    - Also when you hover over a cell with a tower on it, it should display a small menu near it with some info about its stats and upgrades

2. Canvas for smooth image translation and rotation, projectiles, plus additional grid overlay for onclicks
    - Try out Fabric.js for easy canvas implementation or other canvas-focused js engines

3. REBALANCING THE GAME 
    - Vehicles should take away more cleanliness
    - Garbage trucks are good but we should include more variety in the early-game
    - The only real "difficult" vehicle is the garbage truck
    - HUGE difficulty gap between levels 24 and 25, make the ones leading up to 25 more difficult as well
    - Make upgrades more enticing -- there's no real motivation to pick them over buying a next-level tower yet

4. Re-skinning the game to comply with new prompt (the wifi thing -- we gotta collectively brainstorm about that)

5. Add various new features (brainstorm -- we have time now, but don't procrastinate)

6. Maybe create algorithm for random map generation (in addition to the 4 premade maps of course)


  
||  LIST O' BUGS: ||

1. Random game freezes (temporarily) -- likely due to intervals overlapping or something. We can mathematically analyze this.
    - Also causes fewer cars that round for whatever reason and does not stop energy production

2. Upgrades for towers aren't working
    - I can only confirm this for defensive towers as upgrading their damage yielded no damage increases
    
3. For some reason the identifier in the shop doesn't work correctly for the oil production tower
    - It displays as [Object Object]
